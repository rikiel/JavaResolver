\chapter{Conclusion}

In the thesis we presented the \ToolName tool able to compute
data lineage information of Java applications that use data processing
frameworks to access data.

Part of our work was to propose changes to the Symbolic analysis library
to be able to easily add support for new frameworks as the library plugin
and implement such plugins for selected frameworks - Spring JDBC, MyBatis and Kafka.
This demonstrates that such plugins can be used to easily add
support for data lineage analysis of other Java data processing frameworks
with different approach for accessing the data.

The Symbolic analysis plugin should identify the sources and sinks of
data inside framework and then Symbolic analysis library takes care of
creating data flow in an analysed application.

We showed few limitations of our \ToolName tool. Many of them
are related to static program analysis approach and used
Symbolic analysis library.

However, the tests of our \ToolName tool show that the data flow is
computed in reasonable time and thereof can be used in practice.
The tests also create data lineage visualizations.
The visualizations contains the key information about
data sources and sinks and the flow between them.

In our work we focus on the basic features of selected data processing frameworks.
We avoid the advanced features, such as Kafka Streams or Kafka Connector.
We also did not try to provide the implementation for the the whole Spring JDBC Framework,
as it provides quite large possibilities for accessing the data in an SQL database.

In the future development of the \ToolName tool we are planning to add support
for all the mentioned features of the frameworks.
We are also planning to add plugins for new data processing frameworks.
