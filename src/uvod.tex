\section{Motivation}

Data lineage, or provenance, describes where data came from,
how it was derived and where the results are stored.

Lineage can be useful in a variety of settings. For example,
molecular biology databases, which mostly store copied data,
can use lineage to verify the copied data by tracking
the original sources [1]. Data warehouses can use the lineage
of anomalous view data to identify faulty base data [4],
and probabilistic databases can exploit lineage for
confidence computation [10, 12].
\TODO{Citacia - Data Lineage: A Survey}

In our work we focus on Java applications that access and/or transform data.
For these operations, often other frameworks are used to simplify
the application logic and communication with other systems.

In these frameworks, we need to get a graph, where nodes
contains sources and sinks of data and directed edges
are flows between them.

For example, when using database frameworks, in addition to
know how data flow from sources to sinks, we want to know
also what queries are executed to load and store the data.





\section{Goals}

We would like to create a library that meets the requirements of:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Correctness
  \item Accuracy
  \item Efficiency
  \item Support for few frameworks
  \item Easy to add support for new frameworks
\end{itemize}

Correctness and accuracy are the essential requirements of algorithms used
in our library. We have also efficiency in mind, so we precompute as much
as we could.

We implement \textit{plugins} for handling few frameworks, that can be used
in applications to show our approach works well. We chose different types
of frameworks, each with different access to data, so adding support
for new frameworks should be easy to implement - one should identify
the places where application works with data (load, store or just modify)
and algorithm symbolic analysis algorithm takes care of creating
data lineage part.



%Data can be accessed using databases, files, standard input and output,
%using network or many other ways.
%Many frameworks were created to manipulate with the data and
%we would like to develop library, which can identify places
%in these frameworks where data are accessed.


\section{Manta Flow}

Manta Flow is a tool that helps enterprises to get end-to-end
data lineage including custom SQL code. That allows customers to fulfill
compliance regulations or improve data governance.

It extracts and analyses metadata from report definitions,
custom SQL code, and ETL workflows, to create data flows
which span multiple systems and a range of technologies.
Lineages are analyzed based on actual code, and flows can be visualized.
Data paths between files, report fields, database tables,
and individual columns are revealed to users,
and this information can be utilized in a range of roles.

All entities detected by Manta Flow, such as columns or procedures,
are presented to users in a structure designed to simplify navigation.
Users can search for any object in the repository,
or within the visualization itself.

}

As Manta flow does not work with Java code, data lineage
stops when reaching it. The support for Java can bind
previously separated data lineage parts done in databases
and user can get full data lineage when using Java and database
in application.
